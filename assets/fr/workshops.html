                    Equity between men and women is not the most found word in both academics and the private sectors even in 2020. As  this topic is indissociable of building a career anywhere and decisive for the world we are living in, we have invited the CNRS, the UNESCO - L’Oréal Foundation, and some companies to come and share their assessment of the situation.
