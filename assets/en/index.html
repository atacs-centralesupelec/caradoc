        After last year’s successful event (J-RED 2019 with 300 participants  and 25 companies) and considering the specific circumstances related to the COVID-19 crisis, we decided to have a virtual event on November 18, 2020.<br> 
        That is why this year it will be a virtual career convention where employers and PhD students of Paris Saclay meet in a virtual environment, using chat rooms, teleconferencing and/or email to exchange information about job openings, company culture, etc. Companies can be matched with potential applicants as well as search for candidates using the platform.<br>    </p>

  <h1><strong>Check out our history!</strong></h1>
  </br>
  <h2><i><strong>Origins</i></strong></h2>
    <p>
      The convention started in 2011 after an initiative of the research administration of Centrale Paris (before it became CentraleSupélec). It aimed at creating a contact between the PhD Students of Centrale Paris and their future employer, mostly French companies.

      At that time, it was called "Rencontres Entreprises-Doctorants" and was conducted almost exclusively in French.

      After the 5th edition, in 2016, the organizing team decided to change the name of the convention to "Journée de rencontre entreprise-doctorant".
    </p>
    <p>Since its beginnings, the convention was organized by PhD Students and received help from CentraleSupélec (former Centrale Paris). PhD Students from CentraleSupélec Rennes and Metz were invited to join.
    </p>
    </br>
    <h2><strong><i>The 8th edition</i></strong></h2>
    <p> Before the 8th edition, the convention was exclusively targetting the students of CentraleSupélec. At the 8th edition, the event started to get power and momentum. In total, this edition gathered 250 participants and 25 companies. The evening was concluded by the award of three poster prizes and a jazz concert.
    </p>
    </br>
    <h2><strong><i>Birth of CARaDOC</i></strong></h2>
    <p>
      In order to include more of the demographics of PhD Students in Saclay to the event, the team of the 8th edition decided to open the recruitement of the next organizing team to all of Paris-Sacaly and to make the JRED and event friendly to English speakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having gathered the kernel of the new team (around mid June 2019), the former team of the 8th edition asked the new members to choose a new name that would better correspond to the new paradigm. Thus, out of some several name proposals, CARaDOC, standing for Careers and Doctors was born.
