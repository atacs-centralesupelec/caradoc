 <img class="imgleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/team/abarna.png" alt="abarna">
 
Abarna is a third-year PhD student of University Paris-Sud working at  MICALIS institute, at INRA of Jouy-en-Josas. After her Master degree of Infectiology from University Paris-Diderot, she decided to explore the universe of Streptococcus thermophilus, a lactic ferment bacteria used in the production of yoghourt. Her PhD project is about dissecting the role of a transporter in the secretion of pheromones involved in bacterial communication combining microbiology, molecular biology and biochemistry approaches. Being an active member in different organization of internal seminars during her PhD years made her realise her interest to coordinate events. Thereby, she joined  the CARaDOC adventure to rise to the challenge of collaborating with people from different horizons of Paris-Saclay towards a same goal.
