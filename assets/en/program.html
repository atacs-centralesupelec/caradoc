      </div>
      <div class="program-text">
        Equity between men and women is not the most found word in both academics and the private sectors even in 2020. As this topic is indissociable of building a career anywhere and decisive for the world we are living in, we have invited the CNRS, the UNESCO - L’Oréal Foundation (to be confirmed), and some companies to come and share their assessment of the situation.
